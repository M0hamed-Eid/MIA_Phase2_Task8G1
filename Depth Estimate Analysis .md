# Depth Estimate Analysis

# Explanation of the Question

---

To calculate the depth from the camera to each pole, We can use the concept of triangulation by doing the following steps:

1. Measure the apparent size of each pole in the image: First, you need to measure the number of pixels that represent the diameter of each pole in the image. This can be done using image processing techniques.
2. Calculate the angular size of each pole: Divide the number of pixels representing the diameter of each pole by the total number of horizontal pixels in the image (image width) and multiply by the HFOV of the camera to calculate the angular size of each pole. 
    
    ```jsx
    Angular Size (in degrees) = (Apparent Size in Pixels / Image Width in Pixels) * HFOV
    ```
    
3. Use trigonometry to calculate the depth: With the angular size of each pole and their actual diameters, you can use trigonometry to calculate the depth to each pole. You can use the formula: 
    
    ```jsx
    Depth (D) = (Actual Diameter of Pole / 2) / tan(Angular Size / 2)
    ```
    
    1. Where:
    
    D is the depth to the pole.
    Actual Diameter of Pole is the known diameter of the pole (in this case, 15cm or 10cm).
    Angular Size is the angular size of the pole calculated in step 2 (in radians).

Convert the HFOV to radians:

```jsx
HFOV in radians = HFOV in degrees * π / 180
HFOV in radians = 72 degrees * π / 180
HFOV in radians = 1.2566 radians
```

We can assume that:

```jsx
Image width = 600 pixel
Apparent size of 1st pole = 24 pixel
Apparent size of 2nd pole = 8 pixel
```

So, We can now calculate the angular size:

```jsx
Angular of 1st pole = 24/600 * 1.2566 = 0.05 rad
Angular of 2nd pole = 8/600 * 1.2566 = 0.017 rad
```

Final step to get Depth:

```jsx
D (1st pole) = 7.5 / tan(0.05/2 rad) = 299.9 cm
D (2nd pole) = 5 / tan(0.017/2 rad) = 588.2 cm
```
