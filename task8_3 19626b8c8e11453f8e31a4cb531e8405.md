# task8_3

---

Its an object detection model using YOLOv8 ultralytics frame work to detect coins (pound , half pound, quarter pound)

## Collecting the dataset

the data is collected from all the team members and we tried to capture different parameters as we can 

- each coin photos
- mixed coin photos

the dataset was divided to train part and validation part by 80:20 percent then it ordered from 1 to 472 

## labeling

labelimg was used for labeling

### The classes

- 0 for half
- 1 for pound
- 2 for quarter

the file of labeling was saved as .txt file

## Training

colab was used for training to get access for GPU 

then we install ultralytics for commands of yolo 

then we let the model to train for about 200 times 

### the model results

the loss decrease as time pass so we know that the model is good

the percesion and recall were 

the mean average percesion increase by time and was

---

confusion matrix

confidence 

## deployment script

```cpp
from ultralytics import YOLO
model= YOLO('we put the path here')
model.predict()
```

this is simple cpde we used for the deployment and after the test it was clear that the model worked well
