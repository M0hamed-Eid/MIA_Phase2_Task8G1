# WALL-E's Environmental Restoration Project

## Task 8.1 - Classical View

### About
The classical computer algorithms that WALL-E relied on in the past encountered limitations as the complexity of the environmental restoration mission increased. They struggled to adapt to evolving challenges, such as precise object recognition in cluttered landscapes and dynamic path planning in ever-changing terrains.

### Requirement
- Implement a classical algorithm using OpenCV to detect red and blue balls in 20 images.
- Detection could be a circle or bounding box around the object.

## Task 8.2 - Visual Depth Estimate

### About
WALL-E's depth estimation algorithm, enhanced with EVE's technological expertise, provided precise and real-time measurements of the environment's three-dimensional characteristics. This enabled WALL-E to navigate challenging terrains and assess ecological changes with remarkable accuracy.

### Requirement
- Write an article about different methods to estimate depth from cameras and obtain a 3D view of the world using various approaches and camera types such as Mono Camera, Stereo Camera, and RGBD Camera. You can use LaTeX, Markdown, or any other software for the article.
- (BONUS) Implement Block Matching using Python, an algorithm that generates depth maps from stereo images.

## Task 8.3 - You Only Look Once (YOLO)

### About
WALL-E made a remarkable discovery among ancient debris: a collection of Egyptian coins, crafted from a rare and durable alloy. These coins offered a glimpse into Earth's vibrant past.

### Requirement
- Create an object detection model using the YOLOv8 ultralytics framework to detect Egyptian coins. There are three classes: One pound, Half pound, and Quarter pound.
- Preferably, collect some or all of the data for this project from team members rather than the internet.
- Document each step in the data collection and training process, and showcase how the team collaborated on this project.
